### Hi there 👋

Hey! I'm Artem Dychenko, a 2nd year student pursuing Bachelor's degree in Informatics. My interests lie in areas like software development, data analysis, and web devepopment.

🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python and deepening my knowledge of C/C++. I also make algorithms and projects in the Linux environment.


🔍 Currently, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities that will allow me to apply my knowledge in a professional setting. I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team where I can grow, learn, and make meaningful contributions. If you have any exciting projects or internship positions available, I'd love to hear from you!


💡 Reach out to me via my mail(artemdychenko@gmail.com) to discuss potential collaborations, internships, or anything related to software development. I'm always open to new opportunities!
